## Overview 

_Note: Due to starting this DevLog a few weeks after actually starting the project, the first few posts are retroactive_



Create a HUD to create tile maps in Editor Mode

### requirements
* select generation shapes 
* select tile type 
* include toggles for drawing debug 
* include toggles for tile info

### goals
* get comfortable with the basics of working with UI elements in UE5



## Starting off
find that video I used that did a good job explaining how to set up UI elements in UE5

## Making HUD stuff and options



## Hooking up the HUD to the tile generation logic

Make a note somewhere in here about how ChatGPT is good at generating color palettes

## Bonus
Make some superficial adjustment to the BP_Tile object, and make sure we can work with that from the HUD as well

## Overview 

_Note: Due to starting this DevLog a few weeks after actually starting the project, the first few posts are retroactive_



Create a HUD to create tile maps in Editor Mode

### requirements
* Add Elevation options 


### goals
* idk




## Making HUD stuff and options
Adding HUD stuff


## Hooking up the HUD to the tile elevation logic



notes- randomizer and plateau all good, parabola not really getting desired effect- rather than troubleshoot this, we'll keep moving with minimum viable product for now until we get to the key thing, which is proof of concept on the core gameplay mechanics. No sense worrying about specific terrain adjustment stuff that may or may not be relevant
